Agentic News Summarizer (Ongoing Project)

🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains an Agentic News Summarizer, an advanced news aggregation and summarization tool that leverages AI-powered agents to generate concise yet informative summaries of news articles. Additionally, this repo also includes other experimental agentic finance applications aimed at learning and improving AI-based automation.

🔥 Why Agentic News Summarizer?

Unlike traditional news apps, such as Inshorts, which provide manually written summaries, our Agentic News Summarizer offers:

AI-driven summarization: Uses PhiData Agents and Groq’s Llama 3.3-70B model to dynamically extract and summarize key insights from any news article.

Tool-assisted enhancement: Integrates with Newspaper4k, a tool designed to extract news content efficiently.

Real-time updates: Fetches the latest news headlines from NewsAPI, ensuring up-to-date information.

Custom category selection: Allows users to filter news by categories such as Technology, Business, Sports, etc.

Better personalization: Future plans include user-specific recommendations based on interests and reading patterns.

⚡ Features (Planned Improvements over Inshorts)

📰 Automated, unbiased summarization – No human intervention, ensuring purely data-driven summaries.

🌍 Multilingual support – Plan to introduce translation for non-English news articles.

🎤 Voice-based interaction – Integration of voice assistants for hands-free news updates.

🤖 Contextual AI Analysis – AI will not only summarize but also provide deeper contextual insights.

📌 Bookmark & History Tracking – Users can save and revisit articles later.

🔥 Trend Analysis – AI-generated insights on trending topics, helping users stay ahead.

🛠 How It Works

The app fetches news articles using NewsAPI.

The PhiData Agent processes the article URL and extracts relevant content.

Groq’s AI model generates a concise and meaningful summary.

The summarized news is displayed on the web interface.



🛠 Technologies Used

Python, Flask – Backend framework

PhiData Agents – AI-driven agentic automation

Groq Llama 3.3-70B – Large language model for summarization

Newspaper4k – Content extraction from news articles

NewsAPI – Fetching real-time news updates

Fully AI-Powered Summarization: While Inshorts uses AI for assisting in news selection and summarization, it still involves editorial oversight to refine summaries. This project, however, is completely AI-driven, ensuring faster, unbiased summaries with no manual intervention.

Customizable Summaries: Inshorts provides fixed-length 60-word summaries, whereas this app generates adaptive-length summaries based on the complexity of the news. Users can even choose summary length in future updates.

Interactive AI Capabilities: Instead of just presenting summaries, this app will allow users to ask follow-up questions, extract insights, and even analyze sentiment using AI-powered agents.

Domain-Specific Agents: The roadmap includes finance-specific news agents, research paper digests, and industry insights, making it a personalized knowledge assistant rather than just a news app.

Unbiased & Fact-Focused Summaries: Since Inshorts' editorial team might influence how news is framed, this project aims to be completely AI-neutral, ensuring a fact-based, objective approach to news reporting.

Future Features: Voice Summaries & AI Chatbot: Unlike Inshorts, this project plans to include voice-based summaries and an AI chatbot that can simplify complex news in an engaging way.
